        <h2>ENGCMP Soundscape Narrative</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This <b>soundscape narrative</b> was created for my Digital Media Composition course. The purpose was to capture the feeling of baking. From ingredient prep to
            completing and eating the food, I sourced the sounds that I thought would achieve this feeling the best. I used Audacity to edit this soundscape 
            narrative.</p>
