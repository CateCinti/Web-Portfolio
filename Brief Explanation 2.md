Since last time, I've made some major developments to my web portfolio.
I've officially filled in all the information I'd like potential hiring managers to know about me, and I've included all the images/MP3s/MP4s I wanted!
I've also included a link to my LinkedIn, which is important, especially in the field I plan to enter.
My plan for this site is to use it to exhibit my skills in digital media so as to appeal to companies hiring in the digital marketing field.
I'm specifically interested in showing off my work in graphic design, as well as tetsing out the HTML skills I've learned in this class.
My plans now are to make edits to my site via feedback!
