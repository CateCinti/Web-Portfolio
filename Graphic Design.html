        <p class="center">I've been doing graphic design for years. I began learning in high school and have been working professionally
            <br />throughout my college career. Below are a few of my recent graphic design projects.</p>
        <img src="Images/ENGCMP Visual Argument 816 x 1056.png" alt="Visual Argument" class="VA" width="450" height="582.35"/>
        <img src="Images/ENGCMP PGHSC Poster 816 x 1056.png" alt="PGH Social Club Poster" class="PGH" width="450" height="582.35"/>
        <div id="poster">
        <h2>Posters</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The first poster is a <b>visual argument project</b> that was focused on telling a story through imagery. I decided to pose an argument for busy, working
            professionals to adopt hobbies as a way to cool off, avoid burnout, and build new skills. I used Gimp and Adobe Illustrator to create this poster.</p>
        <p>The second poster was created to promote <b>PGH Social Club</b>, a social gathering platform that sets up fun events for young professionals out of college
            who are looking to make new friends. My main goal was to match the attitude of the brand while conveying meaningful information. I used Adobe
            Illustrator and Photoshop to make this poster.</p>
        <img src="Images/Normandy Graphics 3240 x 1080.png" alt="Normandy Social Media Graphics" class="normandy" width="920" height="306.67"/>
        <div id="graphic">
        <h2>Social Media Graphics</h2>
        </div>
        <p>These are examples of social media graphics I've developed for clients. I look at their goals, aesthetics, and target audience to develop the perfect
            designs! In this example, the client is a <b>senior living facility</b> looking to spread information about itself, engage with its residents, and encourage
            people to book tours. I used Canva and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop to create these graphics.
