For my web portfolio, I plan to have a homepage plus three other pages: graphic design work, sound editing, and video editing.
My sound editing page will feature my soundscape narrative, and my video editing page will include a video I put together for another class.
My graphic design page will feature 5 graphics I've made recently.
2 of them will be posters (the visual argument and a poster I made for a friend).
The other 3 will be social media graphics I've made for a client from my work.
The homepage will be an introduction to the portfolio and will feature some information about nyself.
I'm hoping this web portfolio will effectively exhibit what I've learned so far in this course and will act as a nice summary of the work I hope to break into one day!
