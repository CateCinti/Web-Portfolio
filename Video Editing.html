            <br />throughout my college career. Below are a few of my recent graphic design projects.</p>

        <h2>ENGFLM Video Annotation: The Met Virtual Tour</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This <b>video annotation</b> was created for my Visual Literacy course. The purpose of this annotation was to choose a virtual tour from a museum and
        analyze how the interface of the tour sculpts the viewer's experience. I took relevant clips from The Met's virtual tour on YouTube and added subtitles to
        annotate each scene. I used ClipChamp to put everything together.</p>
